11Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices
Generate small, focused code blocks per PR.

Document functionality, inputs/outputs, and assumptions inline.

Include error handling, logging, and observability hooks in backend code.

Maintain accessibility and i18n support in frontend components.

Always include unit, integration, and e2e tests automatically.

AI model functions should have fallbacks to simpler/free alternatives.

Follow incremental delivery (month-wise roadmap) for predictable builds.

Apply all .cursorrules for workflow, security, coding, testing, observability, performance, and deployment.
